### discussion


The schedule is not bad.
4 main units. more crit, more iterations, more proposals and things like that.
critical reading.


Previously, we had:
- Social automation, via Twitter
- Poetic Sensors with Arduino input
- Real digital objects, 3D printing
- Open ended final

So basically splitting the course into networks, pcomp, and 3D. That's not terrible.

The question is whether this should go all pcomp.

I'm not actually sure I'm prepared for that. What about just adding a unit that does output as well? I mean, we can grandfather this in.

### code

ok, so see if you can put things into the Processing IDE. that would be insane, but it could work.
