- grade projects!

///

get: toggles, good 10k potentiometers + caps
red, black, and green wires

- accel
- neopixels
- piezos

- make battery a percentage

### FUTURE

#### GUIDE
- section on breadboards and power rails
- pulsesensor code
- separate code into posting and streaming
- more inputs? more outputs?
- generalize away from AIO in the sections
- more sound, with amps (https://www.coderdojotc.org/micropython/sound/01-intro/)
- touch vs force is weird nomenclature; capacitance is undersold
- have project examples for every sensor, or at least a list of the type of things they might detect (or do, in the case of outputs)



#### PROJECTS
- autonomous sensor object (detect and display)
- data visualization (poetic sensing)
- instrument (real time stream accel)
- + 3d something (start with this?)
