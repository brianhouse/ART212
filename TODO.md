- session for people new to processing

### discussion

4 main units. more crit, more iterations, more proposals and things like that.
critical reading.

- Social automation, via Twitter
- Poetic Sensors with Arduino input
- Real digital objects, 3D printing
- Open ended final

So basically splitting the course into networks, pcomp, and 3D. That's not terrible.

but could nix the 3D printing and do output. still have to keep Twitter because of the delayed start anyway.


poetic sensors needs a processing template (and the p5 template)

- port to micropython?


Then do inputs connected to outputs

can the data vis all be within processing.py?

3D could be a separate 2-week mini unit

could nix the environmental data question. except that's cool.


### questions
- twitter all within the IDE
- data vis all within python
- micropython IDE?

### pcomp futures


inputs
- various sensors

outputs
- piezo (PWM)
- motor
- LED
- light

what's in-between?
- mapping
- delays
- state machines (nonlinear-narrative)

need an intro of basic electronics info? maybe no.


### code

ok, so see if you can put things into the Processing IDE. that would be insane, but it could work.

what does this get me, other than a pain in the ass?

no terminal. ability for people to generate and put in images.
