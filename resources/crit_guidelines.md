# Guidelines for Critique

When commenting on someone's work, consider the following three "C"s:
- Concept: the intent behind the work
- Craft: how the work was made and its formal and aesthetic qualities
- Context: how the work relates to its precedents and to contemporary discourse

Ask questions to clarify the three Cs so that you can learn from each other as well as make thoughtful comments.

\
Make (at least) two comments on every other person's work:
- Point out an aspect of the work that you is particularly strong _and explain why_
- Point out an aspect of the work that you think could be improved _and explain why_
    + do not just volunteer what you would have done differently or speculate on other directions the work might have takenâ€”constructive criticism will consider the relationship between three Cs

\
Some additional things to keep in mind when making comments:
- talk about the work, not the artist
- respect others' backgrounds, abilities, and perspectives
- don't claim the universal

\
Some additional things to keep in mind when presenting:
- don't apologize or add caveats to your work
- have questions to invite the feedback that will be most helpful to you
- listen and take notes
