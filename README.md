# ART 212: DIGITAL MEDIA II

Tuesday / Thursday 8:50–11:20, Fields 205  
[https://github.com/brianhouse/ART212](https://github.com/brianhouse/ART212)  

Prof. Brian House (he/him), [brianhouse@lclark.edu](mailto:brianhouse@lclark.edu)  
Office hours MTW 11:30–12:30


## Course Description
Hybrid worlds studio. Further development of digital media techniques with an emphasis beyond the screen: data collection and sensor systems, 3D fabrication, and augmented reality. Seminar-style reading and discussion will center on conceptual issues arising from a digitally mediated society. Students will work on individual projects for studio critique.

Prerequisites: ART 112 or a CS 100-level course

#### Objectives:
- Cultivate an ability to think in terms of systems that span the physical and the digital
- Understand the ways in which digital tools participate in contemporary culture
- Survey contemporary artists working critically with code, data, and 3D fabrication
- Develop a repertoire of digital methods for studio practice
- Increase proficiency programming with [p5.js](https://p5js.org), [node](https://nodejs.org), and [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc)


## Assignments and Grading

### Projects
This course is built around four projects completed over the course of the semester in the digital media studio, which will be [critiqued by the class](resources/crit_guidelines.md). While there are technical and conceptual parameters for each project, you are expected to be experimental and to develop a personal artistic trajectory. A title and [3-sentence artist statement](resources/artist_statement_guidelines.md) must be included with each project. Cumulatively, the projects account for 90% of your final grade, with the final project given double weight. As work is evaluated via in-class crit, no late work can be accepted.

### Survey presentations
[Each student will give a 10-minute presentations on an artist working in digital media](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HHoVP1O-VfYFJsBo8tri8cBQmJLKuMkgraGmMaQAIxU/edit?usp=sharing). These presentations, which should be organized in slides, should give an overview of the context in which the artist is working and then precede to show one or two artworks in detail. You should comment thoughtfully on how the work relates to the themes discussed in class as well as to your own artistic practices. Students will choose artists on which present [from a list](resources/artists.md) or propose their own for instructor approval. These presentations make up 10% of your final grade.

### Reading
Each week we will read critical texts that situate digital media in society and its impact on the material world. These will are provided through the links on this syllabus. Reading is due on the day where the text is listed; a reading response must be submit before class on the provided Google Doc. This can be a question raised by the text, a critique of it, a link to related artistic work, or some other brief comment which can stimulate our discussion.

### Attendance and participation
You must attend and thoughtfully participate in every class. After the first absence, every absence will result in a reduction of your final grade by 2.5%. Being late twice will be treated as the equivalent of one absence. **Use of social media in class twice will also be treated as the equivalent of one absence.**


## Policies

### Values
It is my intent to lead a course that serves students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and that our varied life experiences may be a common benefit. Content in this studio art course may at times challenge our aethestic and/or ethical values; free exchange of ideas and critique is encouraged and expected, but harassment and disrespect will not be tolerated. During class discussion and critique we aim to be mindful and generous in our interactions and to make everyone feel heard.

### Dynamic Syllabus
This is a new course, and as such is highly subject to change. The version of this syllabus posted online will be updated periodically and is the definitive version. It is your responsibility to consult it and stay up-to-date.

### Laptop Use
Work for this course should be done on a personal laptop—recent hardware and MacOS is preferred. If you do not have access to a laptop, email me and we will make arrangements for you to borrow a machine.

### Open Studio
All students must complete their own work but are encouraged to help each other. To facilitate collective learning, students are encouraged to work in Fields 205.

### Course Fee
There is a course fee automatically paid through student accounts when registered for this class. The fee helps cover software licensing and sensor hardware. However, open source software will be used whenever possible.

### Accommodations
If you have a disability that may impact your academic performance, you may request accommodations by submitting documentation  to the Student Support Services Office in Albany Quadrangle (x7192). Staff in the SSSO will notify me of the accommodations for which you are eligible; please also make an appointment to discuss with me personally.  

### Academic Integrity
Please refer to the policy on [Academic Integrity](https://docs.lclark.edu/undergraduate/policiesprocedures/academicintegrity/) available on the College's 'Policies and Procedures' webpage. The work submitted in Digital Media courses must be conceived of and programmed by you. While learning from and incorporating code from other sources is a natural part of programming (e.g. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org)), you must demonstrate understanding and intentionality in your work, and you may not copy and paste others' code wholesale. Always credit your inspirations and be confident in your original concepts.

### Land Acknowledgement
The Fields Center for Visual Arts stands on the ancestral homelands of the Multnomah, Kathlamet, Clackamas, Tumwater, Watalala bands of the Chinook, Tualatin Kalapuya, and other indigenous nations of the Columbia River. It is important to acknowledge the original inhabitants of this place and recognize that we are here because of the sacrifices forced upon them. As artists working in Digital Media, we must be aware of and resist the many ways computation capitalizes upon and perpetuates violence toward marginalized people.
