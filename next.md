#### PROJECTS
- responsive object (sensor + output) [no network]
- instrument (accelerometers + buttons + lights + streaming data) [what is it on the software side? use dedicated router]
- data visualization (poetic sensing)
/
- 3D printing


#### GUIDE
- section on breadboards and power rails
- pulsesensor code
- separate code into posting and streaming
- more inputs? more outputs?
- generalize away from AIO in the sections
- more sound, with amps (https://www.coderdojotc.org/micropython/sound/01-intro/)
- touch vs force is weird nomenclature; capacitance is undersold
- have project examples for every sensor, or at least a list of the type of things they might detect (or do, in the case of outputs)


#### MATERIAL

get: toggles, good 10k potentiometers + caps
red, black, and green wires

### DISCUSSION

twitter bot is too hard, ultimately. and so is data visualization, but maybe we can work up to it next time.

connecting to foreign wifi is really hard for data visualization
