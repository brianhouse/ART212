Networked automation:
- group collab with CS can also be intimidating
- use atom terminal again?
- group of 4 is too big, 3 max
- use the data & society reading on bots
- emphasize the "automation" bit
- more time on text manipulation? was harder for non-cs

--> check if top-level await is available

- me in front of group discussion kind of sucks. I can give an intro. structure it by table somehow. Specific questions for them to discuss in groups and report?

- the Chun wasn't great. choose a newer one? and swap with Anatomy of an AI?

/
- might need to have a participation grade, depending on how this is structured
