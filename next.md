Networked automation:
- group collab with CS can also be intimidating
- use atom terminal again?
- group of 4 is too big, 3 max
- use the data & society reading on bots
- emphasize the "automation" bit

--> check if top-level await is available

/

- me in front of group discussion kind of sucks. I can give an intro. structure it by table somehow.

/
- might need to have a participation grade, depending on how this is structured
