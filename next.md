Networked automation:
- --> Social Automation is a better title
- no groups (or pairs at most)
- use atom terminal package instead of terminal.app
- use the data & society reading on bots
- emphasize the "automation" bit: having them set up and running on a computer in the studio in the lab for 24-hours prior to crit
- more time on text manipulation? was harder for non-cs
    - make a template for madlibs. and provide the word-lists built-in, with credit to Darius
- essentially, we're making this more about the social interaction and less about loading data
- explicitly introduce the mechanics of twitter: hashtags, all the tweet types, etc
- for the proposal, ask for a collection of examples of tweets in the world that the bot will mimic or otherwise relate to
- emphasize title and description (well, these should go in the twitter header)
- display my twitter feed following all the bots (run on a rasperry pi)
- for social automation, incorporate some apis like the random image service?
--> check if top-level await is available to make the template easier

Poetic sensors:
- use a ESP on the other side too?
- “spooky action” and have an established set of inputs on one esp32 and outputs on the other ... doesn't have to be 1-1 time wise, does it?
- explicitly split weeks into gathering / representing
- have a (short) menu of sensors with wiring examples showing the ESP32 and Arduino code, input(distance/presence ie motion, FSR/touch, light, sound, temp-humidity, heartbeat), output(motor, neopixel, LED, piezo sound)
- use fritzing

stock:
- batteries, sound sensors

What's the right order? Maybe sensors first?


/

- me in front of group discussion limits engagement. structure it by table instead. Specific questions for them to discuss in groups and report?

- the Chun wasn't great. choose a newer one? and swap with Anatomy of an AI?

/
- might need to have a participation grade, depending on how this is structured
