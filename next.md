Social automation:
- display my twitter feed following all the bots (run on a rasperry pi)

Poetic sensors: (--> poetic sensing)
- use a ESP on the other side too?
- “spooky action” and have an established set of inputs on one esp32 and outputs on the other ... doesn't have to be 1-1 time wise, does it?
- explicitly split weeks into gathering / representing
- have a (short) menu of sensors with wiring examples showing the ESP32 and Arduino code, input(distance/presence ie motion, proximity, FSR/touch, light, sound, temp-humidity, heartbeat, distance), output(motor, neopixel, LED, piezo sound)
- use fritzing
- need tilt sensor / vibration example
- need working proximity
- need distance example
- more links to adafruit guides
- presentation should not be front of the room. should be placards.
- filter all 4095s as error
- sound should use FFT

stock:
- batteries, sound sensors, motion sensors
- wire!

so... firmata really works. could use that straight to python for processing? does it work over wireless? pair with an accelerometer?

point being, creating a hardware interface with the glowforge and controls is cool, the question is what it controls (and why) on the processing side

sound art is the superior class. the exercise / project structure is good. and it also has readings.

so eventually, this is a physical computing equivalent to that

may need training prior
