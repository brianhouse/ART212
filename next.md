Networked automation:
- --> Social Automation is a better title
- no groups (or pairs at most)
- use atom terminal again?
- use the data & society reading on bots
- emphasize the "automation" bit: having them set up and running on a computer in the studio in the lab for 24-hours
- more time on text manipulation? was harder for non-cs
    - make a template for madlibs. and provide the word-lists built-in, with credit to Darius
- essentially, we're making this more about the social interaction and less about loading data
- explicitly introduce the mechanics of twitter: hashtags, all the tweet types, etc
- for the proposal, ask for a collection of examples of tweets in the world that the bot will mimic or otherwise relate to
- emphasize title and description (well, these should go in the twitter header)
- display my twitter feed (run on a rasperry pi)
--> check if top-level await is available

- me in front of group discussion kind of sucks. I can give an intro. structure it by table instead. Specific questions for them to discuss in groups and report?

- the Chun wasn't great. choose a newer one? and swap with Anatomy of an AI?

- might need to have a participation grade, depending on how this is structured
