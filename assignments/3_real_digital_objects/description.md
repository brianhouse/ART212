# Project #3: Real Digital Objects

Digital fabrication attempts to close the gap between the speed and flexibility of working on the computer and the physical constraints of objects in the real world. We use software modeling tools, but production is delegated to a robot. While this arrangement makes explicit the idea that information can materialize, it also readily demonstrates how the biases of software interfaces, quirks of data storage, hardware defaults, and all the ubiquitous glitches of digital tools can make their way into physical construction. Likewise, sensors that bring the world into the machine do so imperfectly; models reflect _how_ the machine sees as much as _what_ it sees.

In this project you will explore the relationship between object and information by 3D scanning something in the physical world, manipulating it digitally, and then 3D printing your modified copy. What you choose and how you manipulate it are up to you, but they must serve a conceptual purpose that relates to the themes of the class.

To capture data, you may use the Structure Sensor + iPads from the Digital Media Studio for medium to large objects, or the EinScan-SE for small objects (pending delivery). For cleaning and manipulating 3D models, we will cover [Meshmixer](http://www.meshmixer.com) (free), but you can use any software that imports .obj files and exports .stls. For printing with the Prusa 3D printers (Bart and Lisa), we will use [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/).

This is a 3-week project (not counting spring break) that you will complete individually. This week you will experimented with 3D tools. Next week, you will present a proposal and your progress. The Thursday of the week after spring break will be a crit. To present the work, you will display your prints (and any other objects as relevant) along with a (2D-printed) title and a 3-sentence artistic statement.
