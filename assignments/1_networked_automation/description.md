# Project #1: Social Automation

Representing data is foundational to digital media. "Data" can mean many things, from sensor readings to photographs to search engine results to geospatial coordinates to audio to financial transactions. In all cases, however, how we organize that which has been digitally encoded and make it available to the human sensorium is in itself a matter of interpretation and added meaning.

In this project, you will create an experimental "data visualization" using [p5.js](https://p5js.org) (or another programming language with instructor approval). This will involve finding and manipulating a pre-existing data set (in future work, you will generate your own), deciding how to represent those data, and being intentional about the implications your choices have. You are expected to go beyond a straighforward graph or chart that you might find in a science textbook and to produce something unexpected instead.

This is a 3-week project. This week you will present a proposal of your idea to the class for feedback. Next week, you will present your progress. The following week will be a crit.


Requirements:
- 
- You must articulate your concept with a title and 3-sentence artist statement
