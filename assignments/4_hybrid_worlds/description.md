# Project #4: Hybrid Worlds

So far, we have explored automating social networks, made sensors to interpret the physical world, and worked with 3D representations and fabrication. These are all "cyborg" technologies insofar as they intervene in human activity. For your final project, you may draw from these techniques (and/or experiment with new ones) to develop a project of your own design. Your work must address some aspect of the themes that we have discussed in class and focus on the interrelationship between the physical and digital, but you are otherwise free to take on any topic or method (including non-technical approaches). If you wish, you may develop a previous project in (substantially) greater depth.

Before beginning work, you will put together a proposal. This should take the form of slides, and include:
- Theme that you want to work with, including references to texts from the course (or others)
- 3 artistic precedents (think both in terms of theme and method)
- Proposed method
- New skills you will need to learn

Following your proposal, we will have multiple work-in-progress check-ins where you will update the class. If your project changes from your proposal (which is likely), you will use this to present an updated proposal.

The final deliverable for your project will consist of a title, 3-sentence artist description, and a video. By now, we have seen a variety of artist portfolios with videos documenting their individual works. These are typically 2-5 mins long and give the viewer an understanding of the aesthetics of the piece and what is at stake conceptually. If aspects of your work are online, you can use screen capture and voice-over to present them. For objects and interactions in physical space, you should film themâ€”while smartphone video is acceptable, use a tripod if possible, and pay attention to lighting and editing to create as clear documentation as possible.

Your video should be uploaded to Vimeo with your title and description with a link posted to Slack. We will put these together on a website for a virtual final exhibition.
