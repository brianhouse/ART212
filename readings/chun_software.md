# Wendy Chun, On Software, or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge

Professor at Simon Fraser in Vancouver, previously at Brown
media studies


address the flip/flop "master"/"slave"


Wendy:
"software is a functional analog to ideology"

"In a formal sense computers understood as comprising software and hardware are ideology machines."


what's visual about it?

Althusser’s definition of ideology as “a ‘representation’ of the imaginary relation of individuals to their real conditions of existence" ["imaginary" ties to Lacan, no?]

[hailing example -> false consciousness]

Software produces “users.”

software is imaginary
it imposes subject positions on us
