        With this project, I hope to comment on the abnormality of our newly virtual existence, and the feeling that something imperative to human connection is being lost in this temporary transition from physical to virtual life. Our interactions have become interfaced, and the technology mediating these interactions is unable to preserve the quality of our connections. The discomfort of this reality is obvious, as is the discomfort of wearing a mask which stifles every word you say.

        Bearing definitions in multiple different disciplines, ‘entropy’ is most widely associated with the destruction of closed systems that occurs as a result of a loss of energy in that system. Rocks, trees, planets, our bodies, all experience a kind of entropy. I am curious in exploring this connection we have with other forms of matter like technology to expose the similarities of decay that both natural and technological systems experience. I buried my dead and broken phone in a cemetery as a symbolic connection between the entropy of our dead bodies (energy going back into the ground) and the entropy of our phone systems (how do they decompose?).

        Thinking about how we have moments in our lives when we feel important, where everything feels like it's going right. These moments create a flow in our lives that allow us to be fully present, however they don’t last long. We always hear from society to live in the moment but sometimes we just want to hold onto those rare moments forever.

        This piece is about how these moments make us feel important and special. I wanted to show how I feel inside when I experience these moments. Basketball has been a huge part of my life and game winners are arguably one of the best moments in basketball. This 3D animation is a representation of how I felt at that moment. Where I felt like this deserved to be in a museum for the whole world to see.

        This project is meant to depict simple headlines; exactly what would be meant to capture your attention the moment you notice it, but viewed from a 3rd Dimensional perspective. The articles themselves, sourced from the first page of a Google search for Covid 19 every ten days after the first cases were reported, are represented in one out of the four corners of the environment - a 2 dimensional televised news panel that was likewise stretched into the 3rd dimension. The closer the headlines are to the viewer, the closer they are to the start of the news cycle’s tenuous relation to the Covid 19 pandemic.

        This 3d model is a window into my imagination fighting with covid-19. Inspired by Godzilla destroying cities I created a silly Dino that destroys corona instead. The Dino is a interpretation of my little sisters toy and helps add a bit of levity and humor during these challenging times.

        With guidance from instructions I received from randomly selected individuals on the internet via Twitter, I cut my hair accordingly. The selection process picked from a pool of people who had used the hashtag category #stayhome and the word "change" in a Tweet. This haircut from a distance allowed me 1) relinquish of control in an already chaotic, uncontrollable time & state of the world, 2) interaction with strangers, which strangely enough, I have been finding myself yearning for lately, and 3) the experience of seeing how people react when given the opportunity to control someone from a remote position. This performance also embodies a certain sense of "apocalyptic domesticity"; I attempt to enable a visible change in my physicality to remind myself that I am still changing and moving forward even as my domestic surroundings remain the same everyday.

        My project is named ‘Unused Spaces’. The idea of the project is to give a 3D printed lockpick kit to people without homes in the hope that they will use it to find their own homes in unused spaces. Right now this project is more of an abstract because I do not know how the lockpick set prints or if it even works.

        The Muse of Content is either gazing watchfully into the distance or is contentedly ingesting content. Her 3D-printable form may adorn any city to remember a time when we should have done something but would rather not.

        Please no climbing.

        Thanks,
        Shannon
