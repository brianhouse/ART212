## Burrington discuss

## Crit (<80')

So let's take a look at the exercise. We won't formally critique this work, but let's have everyone show what they did, and I'd like everyone to have questions and comments for each other. [screenshare and show via classroom]

What commonalities and patterns emerged?
- energy usage?
- ambient vs intentionally engaged?
- layers?


## Practicals
- Discuss presentations and sign-up
- This can be a question raised by the text, a critique of it, a link to related artistic work, or some other brief comment which can stimulate our discussion



## Social automation

What's new here from a technical standpoint is that we're no longer coding inside Processing.

Conceptually, we'll be engaging in real-world dynamics that might be out of our control, it's not just a self-contained thing, it's out in the world.
