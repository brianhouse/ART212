We're going to use the first hour or so right now for additional time to work in your groups.

I'm going to want to hear from everyone after that about the concept that have, even if that is a rough draft as yet.
- practically, what it is
- what are the themes that it addresses
- any relevant prior work or inspirations
- from a code perspective, what are the challenges


## Code

First thingâ€”I changed the template a bit:
- change the name of the old folder
- download the new one
- move config.js into it

Review of arrays, loops, and objects using just a `test.js`

Loading a file with data and looping over it
- use Kazemi's corpora
text processing
