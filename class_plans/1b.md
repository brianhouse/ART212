## Cyborg Manifesto (<60')
How do we read theory as artists?  
Theorists and historians are concerned with discourse  
We can have a more naive reading where we take the ideas within at face value  
But we're always looking for how to express this materially. If Haraway says it in words, what do these ideas look and feel like?  
It's also ok to not totally understand what's being said here. We can feel our way through the text. And of course we don't have to agree with it.  

What is the context of this piece?
- Haraway was born in the 40s, pre-boomer, she's from Colorado, and earned her PhD in biology at Yale
- This essay made her famous, as well as infamous
- 1985, we're right between 2nd and 3rd wave feminism (1st: suffrage, 2nd: rejection of patriarchy, 3rd: intersectionality, plurality, recognition that equality and oppression take many forms)

With this essay, Haraway brings technology right into the middle of that.

What are the three binaries that she calls out starting on the third page?
- Human vs Animal: language, tool-use, social behavior, mental events
- Animal vs Machine: automata + simulation, medical devices, even food
- Physical vs Non-physical: "our best machines are made of sunshine", abstract systems, math, code, as opposed to coarse matter (transcendental ideal)

For Haraway, it's not about resolving these binaries, or providing a master framework for them. It's about "permanently partial identities and contradictory standpoints" (72)

Let's all pick out a line from the text that you find interesting, or confusing. Let's hear some of those.

What's the call here? Find ways to be a cyborg. Figure out how this works. Science and technology can't be placed on one side, as tools of power, they have to be means of resistance as well.

So how has that played out? Since 1985 we have the internet and everything that comes with it. Has that increased oppression? Or has it made forms of resistance possible?


## Crit (<80')

So let's take a look at the exercise. We won't formally critique this work, but let's have everyone show what they did. We'll either plug in, or use the document projector.

What commonalities and patterns emerged?
- energy usage?
- ambient vs intentionally engaged?
- layer?


## Practicals
- Discuss presentations and sign-up
- This can be a question raised by the text, a critique of it, a link to related artistic work, or some other brief comment which can stimulate our discussion
