## Reading

The MoMA actually acquired this yesterday

Everyone to generate a question about this workâ€”pay more attention to the image, the PDF than the essay

Write it down
...and then once everyone has that, pose the question to your table for discussion

Report back to the group your conclusions

This can be about the form of the artwork as well as the topic they're discussing


## Presentations

Sam on Julian Oliver
Ethan on Ei Wada
